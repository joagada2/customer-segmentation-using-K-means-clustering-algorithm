## SEGMENTATION OF OLIST ECOMMERCE WEBSITE CUSTOMERS USING K-MEANS CLUSTERING
In this era of data driven business decision making, customer segmentation is an invaluable tool for personalization. Personalization is essential for smart budgeting, product design, promotion, marketing and customer satisfaction. In this project, I created customer segmentation for Olist ecommerce website customers based on orders from 2016 to 2018. I also explored the various clusters a little further and discovered that customers in cluster 2 have far more financial value than those in other clusters while those in cluster 3 have by far, the lowest financial value.
