## customer-segmentation-using-K-means-clustering-algorithmn
In this era of data driven business decision making, personalization is one of the concepts taking the centre stage. It has businesses to take smart budgeting, product design, promotion, marketing and customer satisfaction related decisions. One of the  fundamental steps towards better personalization is customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is the process by which customers are grouped into segments based on combination of common characteristics like gender, hobby, age, time spent on a website, time since user opened an app etc. In this work, I created customer segmentation for Brazilian E-commerce Dataset using the K-means clustering unsupervised machine learning algorithmn. The dataset contains approximately 100k online orders on olist website from 2016 to 2018. The Olist customer dataset used is at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yacinerouizi/e-commerce-customer-segmentation/data).  The dataset has 9 tables with each having information on different metrics on customer and their orders/transactions however, only 7 of the tables will be used because 2 have not information on customer identification.
